Since I only work with Qualcomm devices I only know their tree.

A device tree (or dt) is a set of projects that contain the files and configuration necessary for a device to boot a custom ROM.

## Tree structure

<FileTree>

- device
  - device_brand/
    - codename/
    - soc_model-common/
- vendor
  - device_brand/
    - codename/
    - soc_model-common/
- kernel
  - device_brand/
    - soc_model/
- hardware
  - device_brand/

</FileTree>

- device_brand: motorola, xiaomi, samsung, etc.
- codename: [How to get the Codename of my device?](https://technastic.com/how-to-find-android-device-codename/)
- soc_model: To obtain it, run the following command: 
 ```sh
    adb shell getprop ro.soc.model
 ```

 As an example, we can use the Moto G52 (rhode) device, and the tree would look like this:


 <FileTree>

- device
  - motorola
    - rhode/
    - sm6225-common/
- vendor
  - motorola
    - rhode/
    - sm6225-common/
- kernel
  - motorola
    - sm6225/
- hardware
  - motorola/

</FileTree>

Following this structure, we can organize the name of each project as follows:


- device_motorola_rhode
- device_motorola_sm6225-common
- vendor_motorola_rhode
- vendor_motorola_sm6225-common
- kernel_motorola_sm6225
- hardware_motorola

## Search the tree of a device

To find your device's tree, you can either develop it yourself (requires more research and knowledge) or search for it on GitHub using your device's project name.

<Aside type="tip">

You can start by looking for the device_[brand]_[codename] repository and check the *.dependencies file, which lists the projects you need to compile.
